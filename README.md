  <em>Data Analyst | Backend Developer | Curious Learner</em>
</p>
I’m Aya — a curious mind with a love for patterns, problems, and pie charts.

Whether I’m uncovering patterns in large datasets or building the APIs that serve them, I strive to create solutions that are efficient, insightful, and user-friendly.

### About Me ✶
I’m a Software Developer with a strong focus on data analytics and backend development. I am passionate about turning data into meaningful insights and building systems that power efficient, data-driven solutions.
-I’m currently developing an end-to-end project that blends data analytics and backend development — from cleaning and modeling datasets in Python to building RESTful APIs with Node.js.
-I’m currently enhancing my skills in advanced predictive analytics ,DAX ,and enhancing my BI dashboard skills.
-I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack analytics projects that involve both data insights and functional backend systems.
-I’m interested in learning more about data pipelines, cloud-based solutions, and performance-driven APIs.

My journey started with code, but it quickly grew into dashboards, models, and visual experiments. I’m fascinated by the way a well-designed dataset can speak louder than a thousand meetings.
I believe that clean code, intuitive design, and a little creativity can solve pretty big problems. And I’m here for it.
